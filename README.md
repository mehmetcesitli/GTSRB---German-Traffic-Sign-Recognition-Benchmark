# GTSRB---German-Traffic-Sign-Recognition-Benchmark
An application of German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark using LeNet5 architecture with 93% of test accuracy in 30 epochs using adam optimizer.

The code contains the entire process of:
1. Data retrieval
2. Visualization of Data
3. Data Preprocessing
4. Model building and compilation
5. Model training and testing

You can easily download the code and the dataset on your own computer and test it. Play with the layers of the models, change the hyper parameters, have fun!

This was my term project for Deep Learning and Classification Techniques class, so I wrote a detailed report about the project. It is available on the repository with name "GTSRB_LeNet5_Report.docx". 
 
I got some help during the preprocessing phase of the project. Credits to: https://www.kaggle.com/code/shivank856/gtsrb-cnn-98-test-accuracy
By the way, they implemented another model and got a test accuracy of 98% on the same dataset. Quite impressive, isn't it?
