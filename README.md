# GTSRB---German-Traffic-Sign-Recognition-Benchmark
An application of German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark using LeNet5 architecture with 93% of test accuracy in 30 epochs using adam optimizer.

The code contains the entire process of:
1. Data retrieval
2. Visualization of Data
3. Data Preprocessing
4. Model building and compilation
5. Model training and testing

You can easily download the code and the dataset on your own computer and test it.

A detailed report about the project will be uploaded soon.
 
I got some help during the preprocessing phase of the project. Credits to: https://www.kaggle.com/code/shivank856/gtsrb-cnn-98-test-accuracy
By the way, they implemented another model and got test accuracy Ä±f 98% on the same dataset. Quite impressive, isn't it?
